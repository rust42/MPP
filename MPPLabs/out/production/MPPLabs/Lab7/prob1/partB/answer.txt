The problem in this code is that it does not override correct method for comparing the objects.
The method signature used in Employee.java class has this signature "public boolean equals(Employee e)",
which is incorrect and should use the correct form of equality comparison. Fix would be to use the correct
method and that can be done by overridding this method,

@Override public boolean equals(Object o)
